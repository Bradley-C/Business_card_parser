### Adding new tests
To add or delete tests right click on 'Test_Cards.py' and select 'Edit with IDLE'. This will allow you to enter new tests to validate the functionality of the code further.

The five premade tests should be labled test1 through test5, these can be named anything you wish, just ensure the same convection is used for all new tests, this convection is as follows

```
Test Name = \ """ Your test string here """
```

Also add the name of your test to the testBench below the defined tests by simply typing its name into the square brackets with a common
